# Code of Advent 2024 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024! Each day's challenge is solved using Rust. Here's how to run my stuff:

## Run my solutions

1. **Navigate to any Day's Directory**  
   Move into the directory for the specific day you want to run (e.g., `day01/`).

2. **Edit the Input File**  
   Customize the `input.txt` file in the directory if needed. This file contains the puzzle input for the day.

3. **Run the Code**  
   Use the following command to execute the desired solution:  
   - For **Part 1**:  
     ```bash
     cargo run --bin part1
     ```
   - For **Part 2**:  
     ```bash
     cargo run --bin part2
     ```

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:  
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)  
  Install Rust using `rustup`:  
  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```
